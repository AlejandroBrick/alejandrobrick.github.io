                        <p class="w-100">
                            I am a first generation college student and come from a Hispanic/Latino background. I will
                            be the first in my family to graduate from a university with a bachelor's degree this May 2023.
                            <br><br>
                            I come from a dog training, boarding and grooming background where I dealt with stressful,
                            sometimes dangerous situations daily, made vital decisions that affected peers, clients and their
                            pets. For many years, I led grooming teams efficiently and trained new hires in skills required for
                            dog grooming, daycare and boarding, as well as offered consultations for pet parents and employers in regards to a
                            pet's behavior, health and appearance.
                            <br><br>
                            I am hoping to use the skills I have learned over the past 8 years and apply them towards being a
                            contributing part of a company in the computer science &amp; engineering, information systems &amp;
                            technology, and software engineering fields.

                        <p>
                            My short-term goals this year include fleshing out and deploying the full stack web app I built onto the
                            Amazon Web Services servers and to continue improving my personal website and web scraper which I hope
                            to use to help my friend out with his PC building journey. All three projects have involved a lot of
                            self
                            teaching and experimentation, but they were a good challenge to partake in and I learned a lot of new
                            skills
                            while expanding my knowledge of new programming languages and technologies.
                            <br><br>
                            The Great Minds in STEM and SHPE conference are another short term goal I have which are invaluable in
                            gaining experience and applying for post-grad positions while connecting with recruiters.
                            I have been able to make good use of the mentorship program offered by the ACM club at Cal State LA and
                            the STEM advantage scholars program in order to prepare for upcoming recuitment opportunities and job
                            fairs.
                            <br><br>
                            My long-term goals will be to continue learning new technologies and practicing the ones I have learned
                            recently.
                            An important project I will be partaking in this acaddemic year will be working on website improvements
                            for The Arqive as part of the computer science departments senior design project at Cal State LA. I
                            think this project
                            will be invaluable experience for working with professionals in the field.
                            I am hoping to use all of my experiences and achievements to ultimately get a job in this field and be a
                            contributing part of a team.

                        <p>
                            I wanted to apply for the STEM advantage program because I knew it would be a tremendous help for me in
                            reaching my goals.
                            I felt that I would be put at a great advantage in the program not only for the experiences and community it
                            provides, but also because of the internship opportunities.
                            All of which will be possible via the vast amount of partnerships that this program enjoys with a lot of
                            companies that will be looking for promising new candidates.
                            <br><br>
                            The program offers vital information and experience through professional development and community building.
                            I've been told many times how invaluable it is to have solid interview skills and to come into them armed
                            with practice and knowledge.
                            The scholars program seemed like the best place to receive both of those things. The career panels,
                            interactive workshops and webinars were all things I very much looked forward to for expanding my
                            professional skills;
                            which will be needed for landing a job or internship. Along with my degree, I hope these practices and
                            training will allow me to ultimately reach my long term goals.
                            <br><br>
                            And of course, with all the help I have received thus far and the help that I am receiving from this program
                            and the mentorship through the ACM club, it would not be morally correct for me not to give back to those
                            that are in need as I have been many times.
                            Just as I will be applying to be a leader for ACM next year, I will be hoping to be a mentor or leader here
                            as an alumni to the scholars program for the many youth who will need a helping hand or a guiding voice.
                            I grew up without many positive role models, so I sincerely hope to reach out to those who will come after
                            me and assist them in achieving their goals.
